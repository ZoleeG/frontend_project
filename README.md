# NC News Web App

### Description of the project:

I built [this UI](https://zoleegncnews.netlify.app/) on top of [this API](https://be-project-7l6i.onrender.com/api), which I constructed around a set of dummy data that was provided to me, containing articles, users, comments and topics.

### Description of the app:

NC News - a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.
